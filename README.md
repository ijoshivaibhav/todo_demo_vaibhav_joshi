# Flutter To-Do List App

A simple To-Do List application built using Flutter, demonstrating the use of BLoC for state management, clean architecture principles, and testing.

## Features

- Add a new task
- Mark a task as completed
- Delete a task
- Filter tasks by all, completed, and pending

## Architecture

- **Presentation**: Contains the UI and BLoC for state management.
- **Domain**: Includes entities, use cases, and business logic.
- **Data**: Manages data sources and repositories.

## Prerequisites

1. **Flutter**: Ensure that you have Flutter installed. Follow the [Flutter installation guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) if needed.
2. **Dart**: Dart is included with Flutter, so make sure it's properly installed by running `flutter doctor`.
3. **IDE**: Use an IDE such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).
4. **Emulator or Physical Device**: Set up an Android emulator or connect a physical device. For iOS, use an iOS simulator (macOS only).
